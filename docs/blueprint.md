# **App Name**: Veralogix Smart Mining – Smart Hub

## Core Features:

- Global App Shell: Create the persistent sidebar and top bar for consistent navigation and access to key information.
- Smart Hub Overview: Develop a placeholder screen with empty cards to validate the base layout structure.
- Site Selector: Implement a dropdown menu in the top bar for selecting mine/pit locations.
- Shift Selector: Create a shift selector (Day/Night/Custom) in the top bar to filter relevant data.
- Connection Status Indicator: Design a connection status pill (Online/Degraded/Offline) in the top bar.
- Alerts System: Include an alerts bell icon in the top bar to notify users of critical updates. Populating those alerts is not part of this feature
- User Profile: Feature a user avatar and role indicator in the top bar.
- Core Shared Components: Create reusable components: KPITile, Card, StatusPill, ChartWrapper, MapShell, ViewToggle, OfflineBanner.
- Route Placeholders: Create simple placeholder pages for all routes.
- Smart KPI Tiles (Predictive): Enhance KPITile to show predicted trend and Time to Failure using a sparkline graph.
- Asset Health Score: Display a composite Health Score for heavy machinery on the Smart Hub Overview, generated by ML models analyzing data.
- Intelligent Alerts & Anomaly Detection: Enhance the Alerts System to intelligently filter noise by grouping related alerts and trigger alerts for statistically weird data patterns.
- Dynamic Route Optimization: Visualize haul truck paths. AI can suggest faster routes in real-time based on traffic congestion or road degradation data.
- Geofence Breach Prediction: Use trajectory prediction to alert a driver *before* they cross a geofence line.
- Heatmaps: Overlay AI-generated heatmaps for High Risk Zones based on recent near-miss reports or unstable terrain analysis.
- Shift Handover Assistant: When the shift selector toggles, an AI summarizer generates a Shift Handover Report in the sidebar using Natural Language Generation (NLG) to highlight critical issues from the previous shift.
- Fatigue Management: If the system detects erratic movements or long hours, show a Fatigue Risk indicator on the operator's profile view.
- Natural Language Query (NLQ): Add a search bar to the Global App Shell (or a chat widget) so users can type queries and the dashboard auto-navigates to the relevant data.
- Smart Hub Morning Brief: Dynamically populate the Smart Hub Overview with Top Insights relevant to that specific user's role.
